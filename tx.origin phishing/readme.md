# Tx.origin Phishing Attacks in Solidity Smart Contractsü•∑üèΩ

This repository contains code and an exploit that demonstrates how vulnerable Solidity smart contracts are to using tx.origin phishing for verification.

## What is tx.origin, What is msg.sender?ü§î
Both `tx.origin` and `msg.sender` are global variables in Solidity. They are used to refer to the address of the sender of a transaction. However, there is a difference between the two.

`msg.sender`: Refers to the address of an account or a smart contract which is directly calling a smart contract's function.

`tx.origin`: Refers to the address of an account which is calling a smart contract's function, only account address can be tx.origin.

## How does this phishing attack work?ü§∑üèº

A phishing attack using tx.origin works by tricking the victim into sending a transaction to a malicious contract. 

Once a txn has been sent to the malicious contract which is `./Attacker.sol` in this context, the `receiver` function which contains a transfer function will be called

The authentication will be successful because the `tx.origin` is the victim's address.

The malicious contract will call the `transfer` function which will transfer the funds to the attacker's address.

## How to protect your contracts from phishing attacks

There are a few ways to protect your contracts from phishing attacks. One way is to use a different variable to verify the identity of the sender of a transaction. Another way is to use a library that has been designed to protect against phishing attacks.

## Code and exploit

The code and exploit for this repository can be found in the `/code` directory. The code is a simple Solidity contract that demonstrates how a phishing attack can be launched. The exploit is a script that can be used to test the contract and see how it is vulnerable to phishing attacks.
